warp_scan
=========

A Sinatra Web Wrapper for arp_scan



* How to get started:

1. Create a config file in the root, see `config.yml.example`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rackup`

For some reason the IP address sorting in the jQuery plugin 'tablesorter'
doesn't seem to work too well. If you can fix it, send me a pull request.

PRs for css and js are especially welcome.
